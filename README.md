# Sheet Music Classification
#### Neural Network Project for Galvanize Data Science Immersive

Music is categorized into twelve major keys that allows musicians to follow a framework.


#### Data Collection

The focus of this project was to classify sheet music into their respective keys. The images were collected from over 4000 pdfs

Preprocessing -
Image reduction, quality,

Collected key, time signature, range, tempo, music complexity/difficulty.
